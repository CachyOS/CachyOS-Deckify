During install it will ask what bootloader to use i recommend systemd-boot its the fastest.
Choose your file system i recommend the default
You must use Plasma desktop.

After install you have to do the following
# sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth (go to bluetooth on desktop and configure to enable on boot to ensure it always starts.
# sudo pacman -S yay
# sudo yay -S steam
# sudo yay -S mangohud
# sudo yay -S qt5-tools
# sudo yay -S qt6-tools
# sudo yay gamescope-session-steam-git
# curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

You must now login to your steam account.

Go to show hidden files home\.steam\registry.vdf
look for language it will state the language in two diffrent places. Directly after the 2nd instance press enter to create a space.
Type
# "CompletedOOBE" "1"   
Save and exit.

Download the Steam-Deckify contents to a folder, open a termainal inside the folder.
# sudo makepkg -si

You will now have Return to gamemode in your applications

Goto settings type sddm select login then behaviour(top right)
Make sure  user auto log in and relogin after log out is selected and select plasma one shot from the drop down menu.

Reboot you should log into steam if not type password and if you go to desktop just click return to game mode you will be good.

Problems you might get.
If wifi in steam is showing disconnected go to wifi in steam turn off and then back on, it will ask for password, enter it.
Goto power restart steam, fixed.

There are alot of tweaks that can be done to speed up the kernel its good to check out the cachyos website.

If your not used to systemd-boot your kernel cmd for boot is located at \BOOT\Loader\entries if you add anything to the kernel parameters.

useful command:
# sudo sdboot-manage gen
(saves any changes to boot loader)

You will find kernel level tweaks to add on the cachyos site.

Install your choice of controller manager tdp managment etc. Keep in mind these can override the kernal pstate!

Cachyos has a very useful kernel manager in Applications
its recommended to install the BORE LTO for fastest gaming performace but your free to experiment.

Huge thank you to the CachyOS team for making this Awesome OS
and to NeroReflex for his work on Steam-Deckify
