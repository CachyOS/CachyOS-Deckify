During install it will ask what bootloader to use i recommend systemd-boot its the fastest.
Choose your file system i recommend the default.
You must use Plasma desktop.

After install you have to do the following
``` sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth (go to bluetooth on desktop and configure to enable on boot to ensure it always starts.
 sudo pacman -S yay

  yay -S steam 
  yay -S mangohud

Open downloaded folder, open terminal and type-
#  make
Then 
#  make install
#  sudo systemctl enable --now inputplumber 


You must now login to your steam account.

You will get a warning about KDE wallet click on it and change password, leave it blank and press enter. this will make sure wifi password is not required again on boot.
Reboot you should log into steam if not type password and if you go to desktop just click return to game mode you will be good.

Problems you might get.
If wifi in steam is showing disconnected go to wifi in steam turn off and then back on, it will ask for password, enter it.
Goto power restart steam, fixed.

There are alot of tweaks that can be done to speed up the kernel its good to check out the cachyos website.

If your not used to systemd-boot your kernel cmd for boot is located at \BOOT\Loader\entries if you add anything to the kernel parameters.

# Useful info!

New Asusctl!
# git clone https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl.git
open terminal in folder you cloned.
# make build
Then
# sudo make install

# sudo sdboot-manage gen
(saves any changes to boot loader)

You will find kernel level tweaks to add on the cachyos site.



Cachyos has a very useful kernel manager in Applications
its recommended to install the bore lto for fastest gaming performace but your free to experiment.

Huge thank you to the CachyOS team for making this Awesome OS
and to NeroReflex for his work on Steam-Deckify
