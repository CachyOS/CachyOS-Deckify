ASUSpower is a simple(the way it should be) way to set power levels using power profiles daemon.

This is linked to ASUSCTL and is the proper way to set power control, you dont need TDP.

To use it open steam and add the .sh file as a non steam game. click play, this will open up the simple ui.

Select your power Preference it will set it and close.

As this is not relying on decky loader steam update will not break it!
